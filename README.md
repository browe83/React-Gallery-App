# React-Gallery-App-Project

Thank you for taking a look at my project. I am going for "exceeds expectations." As a result:

1. a loading indicator that displays each time the app fetches new data has been added. Since the data for the three main topic pages can be requested when the page first loads, the loading indicator is only present on the search route.
2. if no matches are found by the search, a friendly user message to tell the user there are no matches is displayed.
3. a 404-like error route that displays a friendly 404 error page when a URL does not match an existing route is included.
