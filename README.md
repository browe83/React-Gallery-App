## About
This project bootstraps an image gallery application using the Create React App and the Flickr API.  After submitting a query, users receive a collection of related-images.

### Technologies
* ReactJS
* VSCode
* GitHub

## Installation
To run this app, you will need a Flickr account in order to obtain an API Key.  An account can be created at: www.flickr.com.
Once you have an account, you will need to go to www.flickr.com/services to request an API key.
After obtaining you API key and cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.  Then create a `config.js` file 
in the `src` folder.  In the `config.js` file create and export const variable called `apiKey` set equal to the key you received 
from Flickr.  Now you are ready to launch the app by running `npm start` in the terminal.
